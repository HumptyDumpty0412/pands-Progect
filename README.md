My exploring plan about Fishers Iris still on it, but few things i can say about my research right now.
1. Edgar Anderson was biologist and callected the data to quantity the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of 3 related species. But Ronald Fisher is matematic and use this workshop and made it famous used a multivariate data set (Im not good at kwnolege of it)
2. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the Lenght and the Width of the Sepals and Petals (in cm). In short : the goal is distinguish the species from each other. in diagramms (which shows 3 colors - red=setosa, green=versicolor,blue=virginica) I noticed what Versicolor and Virginica always mixed together.While Setosa never come togheger none of them. I suppose is called "cluster analysis". (In 3D model however I see 4 colors, and I still dont know what mean yellow one.)
3. Originally used as an example dataset on which Fishers linear discriminant analysis was applied it became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such a support vector machines.
4. Iris Data Set keep in open search in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris. 
5. Contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes.
6. Used as abeginners data set for machine learning purposes
7. Thereby this progect I know what Python have a libraries:  
+scikit-lear (free software library for Python ) anybody can test it without any private access
+ Pandas,
+ Mathplotlib
+ Numpy
+ SciPy
....and Plotly (vizualizatoin tools)
Before I had started something to do with code I used a "import ...as..." for all libraries.
During whole process i had a troble with command git push in CMDR and suddenly open for yourself adding files inside of my repository
